NAME
    UNIVERSAL::new - Load a module when you call the new method on it

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
      use UNIVERSAL::new;

      my $object = HTTP::Tiny->new; # HTTP::Tiny gets loaded

DESCRIPTION
    This module installs a universal, fallback "new" method. When called, it
    loads the invoking module like "require" would. If the module has a
    "new" method, control is transferred to that method.

    This is most useful for command line scripts via the U alias:

      $ perl -MU -we 'HTTP::Tiny->new->mirror(...)'

    Otherwise, you wind up repeating your module name, and that's painful
    for a "one-liner":

      $ perl -MHTTP::Tiny -we 'HTTP::Tiny->new->mirror(...)'

    If the module is not installed or if it does not have a "new" method,
    the usual exceptions are thrown.

CAVEAT
    Warning: Mucking with UNIVERSAL is a potentially fragile, global hack
    that could have unintended consequences. You should not use it in
    production unless you are willing to accept that risk.
